    <h1>WELCOME TO AMERICAN PREPARATORY ACADEMY</h1>
    <u>
        <h2>About Our School</h2>
    </u>
    <mark>Our story began in 2002 with a small group of dedicated parents who envisioned a school for their children
    that would help them to flourish and be happy people, and who would grow up and support America’s democratic republic as
    well-informed citizens. 25 years later, we are still excited every day to see our happy students grow and achieve.
    American Preparatory Academy has become an award-winning public charter school, now serving over 5,000 students at six
    campuses in Utah.</mark>
